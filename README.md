For Rom Devs: IF you want to inline this kernel in your Roms then do this before building ( In kernel root directory ):

curl -LSs "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tiann/KernelSU/main/kernel/setup.sh" | bash -

Do this Everytime you clone the repo bcz this kernel has the support for Kernel-SU and it needs to be recloned and checkout to latest stable tag.
